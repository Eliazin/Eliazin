### Hello, my name is Eliezer and I'm 24 years old, I've been programming since 2021, started as an Intern at FIT (right now as a fullstack dev) and I've been working with python, golang angular and react for 3 years

### I always had a lot of interest on technologies and also I'm a great fan o videogames(my first was a snes) and because of that I choose to do a college in Analysis and Systems Development at Facens(Faculdade de Engenharia de Sorocaba).
