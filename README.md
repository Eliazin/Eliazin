### Hello, my name is Eliezer and I'm 20 years, I started programming this year using Java, C language, and most recently Python and I'm working as a Intern on Flex FIT
### I always had a lot of interest on technologies and also I'm a great fan o videogames(my first was a snes) and because of that I choose to do a college in Analysis and Systems Development at Facens(Faculdade de Engenharia de Sorocaba).

### Now that i introduced myself, BRING ME KENOBI (Just kidding)
